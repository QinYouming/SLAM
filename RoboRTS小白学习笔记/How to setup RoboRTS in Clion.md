## How to setup RoboRTS in Clion

1. Download the latest source code from KevinLADlee robomaster on github

   https://codeload.github.com/KevinLADLee/RoboRTS/zip/master

2. Create a workspace directory "RoboRts_ws/src", and put the "RoboRTS-master" under this directory

3. in the terminal, cd to this directory, and catkin_init_workspace

4. open the "src" in Clion

5. in the terminal, cd to /RoboRts_ws and type the following command:

   $ catkin_make messages_generate_messages

6. in Clion, go to preference, and change the default build directory to "RoboRts_ws/build", which was automatically generated by step 5: ![1532254570993](/tmp/1532254570993.png)

   note: "-j8" means build with 8 cpu thread. Manipulate it if needed.
